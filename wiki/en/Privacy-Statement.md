# Privacy Statement

**The English version of this document represents the official privacy statement. Should a conflict arise between the English language version and any translation hereof, the English version shall prevail. This statement applies to the _current version_ of the Jamulus software. Earlier versions may have had different privacy terms which are no longer applicable. Users are encouraged to use the most current version of the Jamulus software.**
 

## Definition of Terms

- "**Server**" The Jamulus Server software running on a remote computer to which you will connect.
- "**Client**" The Jamulus software running on your local computer used to connect to a Server
- "**Directory**" A Jamulus Server configured to supply a list of Servers to Clients

## Jamulus.io Web site

The website at [jamulus.io](https://jamulus.io) is served using GitHub Pages. See Github's [privacy policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) for information relating to data collection and privacy.

## Jamulus Software

Jamulus is open source software and can therefore be modified by others. As such, the Jamulus project makes no representations related to privacy, data collection, or security with respect to your use of the software.  

## General Information

Under normal use with unmodified software, your user profile information is exchanged with Servers you connect to, peers connected to those same Servers, and to any interested third party (including Directories) that uses the Jamulus protocol.  This information is limited to your Jamulus name, city, country, instrument, and skill level as you have set them in your profile.  The Servers you connect to will also have access to your internet address (IP Address) as it is required for the software to work; but this information is not shared with peers on the same Server or normally available to third parties. 

All communications between and among Clients, Servers, Directories, and third-party protocol users are sent without encryption.

## Jamulus Servers

When you connect to a Server, either directly or through a Directory, the operator of that Server is responsible for its operation policy, privacy policy, and data use policy. While unmodified Servers do not log or store your connection or profile information, some modified Servers may do this; therefore, you should have no expectation of privacy with respect to your profile information or internet address.

## Chat Exchanges

Chats are textual messages that can be exchanged between Clients connected to the same Server. Everyone connected to a Server can see all chats and there should be no expectation of privacy with respect to information sent through the chat feature of Jamulus. While unmodified Servers do not log or store chats, some modified Servers may do this.

## Audio Recordings

Unmodified Servers will display a notice if recording is turned on. Recordings of each player are stored by the Server and are controlled by the Server operator.

It is possible for connected Clients to make recordings of sessions outside of Jamulus itself, for which there may be no notice or indication. Jamulus has no way to detect or control these situations and makes no representations as to the collection or use of such recording data.

## Directories

Directories are central connection points for locating Servers. The Jamulus Client comes with a pre-defined list of Directories for the convenience of users. These Directories are independently operated but are represented as running unmodified versions of the Jamulus software.
